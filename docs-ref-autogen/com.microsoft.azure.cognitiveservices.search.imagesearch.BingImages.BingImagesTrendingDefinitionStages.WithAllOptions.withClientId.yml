  summary: "Bing uses this header to provide users with consistent behavior across Bing API calls. Bing often flights\n   new features and improvements, and it uses the client ID as a key for assigning traffic on different\n   flights. If you do not use the same client ID for a user across multiple requests, then Bing may assign the\n   user to multiple conflicting flights. Being assigned to multiple conflicting flights can lead to an\n   inconsistent user experience. For example, if the second request has a different flight assignment than the\n   first, the experience may be unexpected. Also, Bing can use the client ID to tailor web results to that\n   client ID\\u2019s search history, providing a richer experience for the user. Bing also uses this header to help\n   improve result rankings by analyzing the activity generated by a client ID. The relevance improvements help\n   with better quality of results delivered by Bing APIs and in turn enables higher click-through rates for the\n   API consumer. IMPORTANT: Although optional, you should consider this header required. Persisting the client\n   ID across multiple requests for the same end user and device combination enables 1) the API consumer to\n   receive a consistent user experience, and 2) higher click-through rates via better quality of results from\n   the Bing APIs. Each user that uses your application on the device must have a unique, Bing generated client\n   ID. If you do not include this header in the request, Bing generates an ID and returns it in the\n   X-MSEdge-ClientID response header. The only time that you should NOT include this header in a request is the\n   first time the user uses your app on that device. Use the client ID for each Bing API request that your app\n   makes for this user on the device. Persist the client ID. To persist the ID in a browser app, use a\n   persistent HTTP cookie to ensure the ID is used across all sessions. Do not use a session cookie. For other\n   apps such as mobile apps, use the device's persistent storage to persist the ID. The next time the user uses\n   your app on that device, get the client ID that you persisted. Bing responses may or may not include this\n   header. If the response includes this header, capture the client ID and use it for all subsequent Bing\n   requests for the user on that device. If you include the X-MSEdge-ClientID, you must not include cookies in\n   the request."
