  summary: "Returns a path that is this path with redundant name elements eliminated.\n <p>\n It derives from this path, a path that does not contain redundant name elements. The \".\" and \"..\" are special\n names used to indicate the current directory and parent directory. All occurrences of \".\" are considered\n redundant. If a \"..\" is preceded by a non-\"..\" name then both names are considered redundant (the process to\n identify such names is repeated until is it no longer applicable).\n <p>\n This method does not access the file system; the path may not locate a file that exists. Eliminating \"..\" and a\n preceding name from a path may result in the path that locates a different file than the original path"
