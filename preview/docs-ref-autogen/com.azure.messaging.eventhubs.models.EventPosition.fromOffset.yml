  summary: "Creates a position to an event in the partition at the provided offset. The event at that offset will not be\n included. Instead, the next event is returned.\n\n <p>\n The offset is the relative position for event in the context of the stream. The offset should not be considered a\n stable value, as the same offset may refer to a different event as events reach the age limit for retention and\n are no longer visible within the stream.\n </p>"
