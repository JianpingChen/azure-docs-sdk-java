  summary: "Constructs a relative path between this path and a given path.\n <p>\n Relativization is the inverse of resolution. This method attempts to construct a relative path that when resolved\n against this path, yields a path that locates the same file as the given path.\n <p>\n A relative path cannot be constructed if only one of the paths have a root component. If both paths have a root\n component, it is still possible to relativize one against the other. If this path and the given path are equal\n then an empty path is returned.\n <p>\n For any two normalized paths p and q, where q does not have a root component,\n     <code>p.relativize(p.resolve(q)).equals(q)</code>"
