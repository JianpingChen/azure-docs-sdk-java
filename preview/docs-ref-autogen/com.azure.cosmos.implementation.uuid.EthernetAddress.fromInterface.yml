  summary: "Factory method that locates a network interface that has\n a suitable mac address (ethernet cards, and things that\n emulate one), and return that address. If there are multiple\n applicable interfaces, one of them is returned; which one\n is returned is not specified.\n Method is meant for accessing an address needed to construct\n generator for time+location based UUID generation method."

  returns:
    description: "Ethernet address of one of interfaces system has;\n    not including local or loopback addresses; if one exists,\n    null if no such interfaces are found."
